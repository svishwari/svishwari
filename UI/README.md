# Getting Started with Unified UI Application

## Environment

* To configure your local development environment, copy the example `.env.example` file to a `.env.local` and populate it with your local dev environment values.
* Read more on this [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/#adding-development-environment-variables-in-env).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

* Runs the app in the development mode.
* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
* The page will reload if you make edits.
* You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

* Work in Progress

### `yarn build`

* Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
* It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
* The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
