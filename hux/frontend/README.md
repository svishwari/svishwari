# Hux UI

## Project setup

yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```sh
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```sh
yarn build
```

### Run your unit tests
```sh
yarn test:unit
```

#### Snapshots
If you have updated a reusable component's template, be sure to update the
snaphots for them and commit them with your changes using:

```sh
yarn test:unit -u
```

### Lints and fixes files
```sh
yarn lint
```

> **ðŸ’¡ PRO TIPS**
> 1. If your branch's CI is failing but locally your lint and/or
> unit tests are passing (or vice versa), try a fresh install locally:
>    ```sh
>    rm -rf node_modules
>    yarn install # or yarn ci
>    ```
>    This should clear up most issues.
>
> 2. Use **`yarn <command>`** â€” <ins>do not</ins> use **`npm <command>`** and
> remove `package-lock.json` if somehow you ended up with one locally.
