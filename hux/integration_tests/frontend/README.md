# End-to-end tests

This is to run integration tests that cover end-to-end functionality of the
Unified UI, via the UI through to the underlying API, database and
services.

## Pre-requisites

Ensure you have the complete application and services running within an
environment and that these integration tests have access to this environment.

This includes the following.
- UI
- API
- Database
- Services
  - Okta

## Getting started

Install integration tests dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

Run the integration tests in headless mode (CLI).

```sh
npm run test
```

Run the integration tests in browser with the Cypress app.

```sh
npm run test:dev
```

## Running with Docker

### Pre-requisites

Have the UI running locally configured for Docker's needs using the following.

```sh
cd ../../frontend
yarn serve:docker
```

Verify its running and accessible from https://host.docker.internal:9090

### Build

```sh
docker build --no-cache -f Dockerfile -t ui-integration-tests .
```

### Run

Run the tests, using your defined configuration and environment variables.

```sh
docker run ui-integration-tests npm run test -- --config baseUrl=https://host.docker.internal:9090 --env FOO=foo,BAR=bar
```

To avoid environment variables being packaged with the build, we ignore any
environment variables configured in `cypress.env.**.json` and instead define
the environment variables at run time.

Here is an example run with custom configuration and environment variables,
where we have exported both our configuration (eg. baseUrl) and environment
variables (eg. USER_EMAIL and USER_PASSWORD) and passed them in at runtime.

```sh
export CYPRESS_BASE_URL=https://host.docker.internal:9090
export CYPRESS_USER_EMAIL=<e2e_test_user_email>
export CYPRESS_USER_PASSWORD=<e2e_test_user_password>
```

```sh
docker run --ipc=host ui-integration-tests npm run test -- --config baseUrl=$CYPRESS_BASE_URL,video=true --env USER_EMAIL=$CYPRESS_USER_EMAIL,USER_PASSWORD=$CYPRESS_USER_PASSWORD
```

To review/debug test runs, mount volumes for the tests, logs and outputs.

```sh
export CYPRESS_LOGS="$(pwd)"/logs:/root/.npm/_logs
export CYPRESS_DEV="$(pwd)"/cypress:/app/cypress
docker run -it --ipc=host -v $CYPRESS_LOGS -v $CYPRESS_DEV ui-integration-tests npm run test -- --config baseUrl=$CYPRESS_BASE_URL,video=true --env USER_EMAIL=$CYPRESS_USER_EMAIL,USER_PASSWORD=$CYPRESS_USER_PASSWORD
```

These are useful for debugging runs locally, where you can view the tests'
output logs, screenshots and videos directly.
